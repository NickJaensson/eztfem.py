``eztfem.py`` documentation
===========================

Welcome to the ``eztfem.py`` documentation page. ``eztfem.py`` is a simple 
toolkit for the finite element method (FEM) intended for use  in teaching 
finite elements for fluid flow. It is developed and maintained by Nick Jaensson 
at the Eindhoven University of Technology. Since ``eztfem.py`` consists of 
Python functions only, it is easily accessible for students.

Eztfem.py can be seen as a significantly reduced version of ``TFEM``, which is 
developed and maintained by Martien Hulsen at the Eindhoven University of 
Technology.
