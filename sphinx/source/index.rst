eztfem.py documentation
=======================

Install the eztfem package by running the following command in the eztfem.py
root directory:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install -e .

Note: this will install the pacakge in `editable` mode, which means that the
package links directly to the code (instead of copying it to the Python 
environment), thus changes to the package will be reflected immediately.
