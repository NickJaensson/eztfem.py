eztfem.py documentation
=======================

Welcome to the eztfem.py documentation page. Eztfem is a simple toolkit for 
the finite element method (FEM) intended for use  in teaching finite elements 
for fluid flow. It can be seen as a significantly reduced version of TFEM 
(developed and maintained by M.A. Hulsen at the Eindhoven University of 
Technology). Since eztfem.py consists of Python functions only, it is 
easily accessible for students.
