running examples
================

All examples are available as normal Python scripts (``.py``) and as 
Jupyter Notebooks (``.ipynb``). For post-processing (e.g., plotting), we 
recommend using the Jupyter Notebooks, since data will remain available 
after running functions.

Using VS Code, Jupyter Notebooks can be run directly after installing the 
relevant extensions. Python scripts can be run by clicking the Play button 
above the script. This will open a terminal and run the script with the Python 
version as defined by your VS Code setup. 

For more details on the examples, see Section ``examples``.
